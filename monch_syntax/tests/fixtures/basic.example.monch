# Basic parser test for Monch syntax
# The parser should be able to understand everything listed here

# Command invocations with bare terms
echo one two three

# Command invocations with double-quoted terms
echo "one" "two" "three"

# Command invocations with mixed bare, single- and double-quoted terms
echo "one" 'two' three

# Comments anywhere
echo arg2 arg2 # not parsed arg3

# Bare arguments
ls -l --inode
ls --quoting-style 'shell'

# Pipes
ls | xargs 'cat'

# Output redirection
ls >file_listing.txt

# Input redirection 
cat <file_listing.txt

# Everything at once
'first quoted cmd' <'input file' bare "doublequote" | second-cmd >output-file "arg" # and a comment
